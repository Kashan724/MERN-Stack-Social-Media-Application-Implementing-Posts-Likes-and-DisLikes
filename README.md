Frontend: I used React to build the user interface, integrating Redux for efficient state management to handle the dynamic data flow within the application. Material UI was chosen for its comprehensive set of pre-designed components, which sped up the development process and ensured a consistent, modern look and feel.

Backend: The backend was built using Node.js and Express. I designed a robust RESTful API to handle CRUD operations for user profiles, posts, comments, and likes. MongoDB was used as the database due to its flexibility and scalability, fitting well with the JSON-like data structures we were working with.

Authentication: Implementing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication was one of the critical security features. This ensured that user sessions were secure and that data was protected from unauthorized access.
Challenges

One of the main challenges was implementing real-time features such as live notifications and messaging. To address this, I integrated Socket.io, which allowed for efficient and scalable real-time communication between users. Another challenge was ensuring the application could handle a large number of concurrent users. I conducted load testing and optimized queries and components to improve performance.
Measuring Success

Success was measured through several key metrics:

    User Engagement: Monitored through the number of active users, posts, comments, and likes.
    Performance Metrics: Load times and server response times were closely tracked to ensure a smooth user experience.
    User Feedback: Collected through surveys and direct feedback, which helped in iterating and improving the platform continuously.
